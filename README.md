# Extrapolation-Python
Extrapolation is a type of estimation, beyond the original observation range, of the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable. It is similar to interpolation, which produces estimates between known observations, but extrapolation is subject to greater uncertainty and a higher risk of producing meaningless results. This program implements Extrapolation Method in python programming language. By entering the point at which you want to calculate, you can find the value.
